The MicroGame is an experiment of making a custom portable platform for gamming compatible with Arduino. It's based on a small monochrome 128x64 pixels OLED from Adafruit and a ATmega32U40 8-bits microcontroller running at 8MHz.
All hardware design and game source code is writed from scratch and you can find all the file sin this repository if you want to build your own. You can modify, share and make improvements as you like but do not forget to shoot me and email and show me your work!
